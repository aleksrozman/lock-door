# lock-door
First Swift iOS project connected to a Particle Photon

The objective is to learn a little swift, an little xcode, and build an app on a phone that communicates with the photon.

The photon is connected to some hall effect sensors which detect the state of some doors, and also has the ability to lock doors. This app allows quick and easy status checking and closing of the door. With the addition of the lock on launch, Siri command "Launch lock door" can be used to lock the door
